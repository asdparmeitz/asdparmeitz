Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m Adam, a last year Masterâ€™s student at Chalmers University of Technology specializing in Machine Learning and Data Science. Iâ€™m curious by nature and enjoy experimenting, learning, and applying my skills through projects and coursework.

Interests:

LLMs & AI

Algorithms & automation

Financial modeling & options pricing

SQL, UX/UI, cloud platforms, DevOps

Outside tech:
Former mediocre football player turned martial artist turned shitty golfer. Also, to let out steam from my shitty golfing, I do weightlifting and running. 

Background:
Iâ€™ve spent years working outside tech with everything from construction to customer service, which taught me responsibility, problem-solving, and teamwork. Now, Iâ€™m focused on building a career in data science.
