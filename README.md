## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Adam, currently pursuing my Master's degree in Complex Adaptive Systems at Chalmers University of Technology. My passion for AI and machine learning drives me to continuously learn and experiment, applying my knowledge through individual and joint projects. While thereâ€™s still much to learn, youâ€™ll likely see a few foundational projects here showcasing my learning journey. Here are a few things Iâ€™m currently working on, or would love to dive into further:
- LLM/AI
- Algoritms & automation
- Options, pricing and evaluation
- Leveraging machine learning and AI tools for trading
- SQL
- UX/UI
- Cloud Platforms and DevOps


## What I do when I am not on the computer
I love to move, and as I sit around the computer more and more it is also becoming sort of a necessity. 
My regular go-to activities include:
- Yoga
- Golf
- Fitness/Crossfit
- Hiking 
- Fishing and outdoors activities
  
As long as it involves movement, I am pretty much up for it.
