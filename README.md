## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Adam, currently pursuing my Master's degree at Chalmers University of Technology with a focus on Machine Learning and Data Science. I dabble a lot and try to continuously learn and experiment, applying my knowledge in projects and schoolwork. 

Thereâ€™s alot that I am interested in and youâ€™ll likely see a few foundational projects here. Curios about:
- LLM/AI
- Algoritms & automation
- Options, pricing and evaluation
- SQL
- UX/UI
- Cloud Platforms and DevOps


## More about me
I've practiced sports my entire life, mostly football up until my early twenties and most recently martial arts. But I realized at 23, when my knee started to miss essential parts, that I might have to stay away from contact sports. Instead I now lift up heavy things repeatedly or walk around for hours cursing and abusing a small white ball. 
My regular go-to activities (no preferred order):
- Golf
- Weightlifting
- Running
- Beering

## Why I have an awkvard GitHub
Unlike many in tech, Iâ€™ve spent years working outside the field. From full-time construction to part-time jobs in customer service and retail alongside my studies. Apperantly, no one in construction have data science contacts(!?) and skills such as drilling concrete or managing people is not "transferrable". On top of that, in the quota of engineers, 5+ years of university studies is not very special. So, I'm trying to sell a small part of my dignity to coorporate for a chance to apply my hard earned, student-loan financed knowledge at a workplace.
